I was able to create my first Sinatra Web Application over the past week. I found the experience to be very fulfilling, learning about how to engineer a login and logout process that includes securing passwords was especially exciting. I had alot of fun playing with various associations that the Sinatra framework allows us to create and support, and eventually settled on a simple Users to Books association for a web application that tracks a list of books.

The application has Users and Books, and each Book belonged to a User, who could have many Books. It was tempting to dig even deeper and start to develop an application with 5 or 10 different models and associations, but I wanted to keep the project simple and basic. I do believe that in the future I will definitely be able to duplicate this framework to build an application that is far more advanced, and possibly even circle all the way back to rebuild the framework once the application is built out.

To summarize - I am extremely excited to start applying everything I have learned throughout this Sinatra framework learning block, and it feels like this is just the tip of the iceberg!
